AUbatch help menu
run <job> <time> <priority>: submit a job named <job>, execution time is <time>, priority is <pr>
list: display the job status
help: print help menu
fcfs: change the scheduling policy to FCFS
sjf: changes the scheduling policy to SJF
priority: changes the scheduling policy to priority
test <benchmark> <policy> <num_of_jobs> <arrival_time> <priority_levels> <min_CPU_time> <max_CPU_time>
quit: exit AUbatch | -i quits after current job finishes | -d quits after all jobs finish
